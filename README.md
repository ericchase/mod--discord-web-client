## History

This project is the successor to my attempt at creating a semi-automated modder for the Discord desktop client (https://github.com/ericchase/mod--discord-client). The desktop client has a TON of issues before even getting to styling. After months of working against their constant updates, I decided to uninstall and start using the browser client.
